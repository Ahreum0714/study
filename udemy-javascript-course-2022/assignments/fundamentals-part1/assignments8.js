// LECTURE: Equality Operators: == vs. ===
// 1. Declare a variable 'numNeighbours' based on a prompt input like this:
// prompt('How many neighbour countries does your country
// have?');
// 2. If there is only 1 neighbour, log to the console 'Only 1 border!' (use loose equality
// == for now)
// 3. Use an else-if block to log 'More than 1 border' in case 'numNeighbours'
// is greater than 1
// 4. Use an else block to log 'No borders' (this block will be executed when
// 'numNeighbours' is 0 or any other value)
// 5. Test the code with different values of 'numNeighbours', including 1 and 0.
// 6. Change == to ===, and test the code again, with the same values of
// 'numNeighbours'. Notice what happens when there is exactly 1 border! Why
// is this happening?
// 7. Finally, convert 'numNeighbours' to a number, and watch what happens now
// when you input 1
// 8. Reflect on why we should use the === operator and type conversion in this
// situation

// const numNeighbours = prompt(
//     'How many neighbour countries does your country have?');
const numNeighbours = Number(
    prompt('How many neighbour countries does your country have?'));

if (numNeighbours === 1) {
    console.log('Only 1 border!');
} else if (numNeighbours > 1) {
    console.log('More than 1 border!');
} else {
    console.log('No borders');
}

// LECTURE: Logical Operators
// 1. Comment out the previous code so the prompt doesn't get in the way
// 2. Let's say Sarah is looking for a new country to live in. She wants to live in a
// country that speaks english, has less than 50 million people and is not an
// island.
// 3. Write an if statement to help Sarah figure out if your country is right for her.
// You will need to write a condition that accounts for all of Sarah's criteria. Take
// your time with this, and check part of the solution if necessary.
// 4. If yours is the right country, log a string like this: 'You should live in Portugal :)'. If
// not, log 'Portugal does not meet your criteria :('
// 5. Probably your country does not meet all the criteria. So go back and temporarily
// change some variables in order to make the condition true (unless you live in
// Canada :D)
const population = 51;
const country = "korea";
const language = "english";
const isIsland = false;

if (language === 'english' && population < 50 && !isIsland) {
    console.log(`You should live in ${country} :)`);
} else {
    console.log(`${country} does not meet your criteria :(`);
}
